          <h4>Organizational Design<br>
          Design for America - Fall 2015 to Spring 2016<br>
          Team Members: Sydney Cheng, Holly Loomer and Natalie Yap</h4>

          <br>
           
          <h5>Assignment</h5>
          The goal was to reduce the amount of waste our campus (Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute) created. This project was a returning project to Design for America Rensselaer, meaning that a team (consisting of my three other teammates) had worked on this problem the year prior to my involvement.
          
          <br><br> 
          
          <h5>Background</h5>
          The prior team created an event called Drop or Swap where students could donate their unwanted items, such as clothing, dorm items, canned goods, and books, on the day of the event. The donated items were then put on display during Drop or Swap, allowing for students to take home whatever they found. At the end of the day, the unclaimed items were donated to GoodWill. The event was very successful and they donated several garbage bags worth of clothes to GoodWill. This event was put on by the team's members and student volunteers, most of them being friends of team members or members of Design for America Rensselaer.
           
          <br><br>

          <h5>Research and Problem Definition</h5>
          Since an organizational design was already put into place, the problem was how to improve this event. Our team defined improvement as a larger number of goods moved through the event; not necessarily donated to GoodWill (although, this would be great), but simply a greater number of goods collected. This would show that our team was diverting a greater number of goods from the trash. In order to have a greater number of goods collected, more students and members of the community had to be aware about our event.<br><br>
           
          In addition, our team wanted Drop or Swap to have a bigger impact on our community, more specifically, the community of Troy, where Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute is located. We defined a bigger impact as recycling more items back into the community.<br><br>
           
          Lastly, our team was in need of a better counting method of collected goods. The previous team simply counted by hand the number of goods that entered and the number that was picked up by students. They kept count by making tallies on sheets of paper in different categories (clothes, canned goods, books, dorm items, etc.). The previous team stated how difficult it was to keep track of all of the items that moved through the event, especially given the limited amount of volunteers.
          
          <br><br>
           
          <h5>Design and Development</h5>
          Our team started with working on the awareness of Drop or Swap, thus hopefully having an impact on the number of items moved through the event. Our main target group was the students of Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute since the event takes place on the campus. Our secondary target group was the citizens of Troy. Our group decided to focus less on targeting this group since Troy is a big community and advertising to "all citizens of Troy" would be difficult. In addition, RPI's campus is not central to Troy so citizens of Troy would have to go out of their way to donate goods whereas it may be more convenient for them to donate items directly to GoodWill.<br><br>
           
          Our team realized that it is important to build name recognition and brand awareness. These would allow for an overall increase in familiarity and popularity of the event. Although this would only be the second year Drop or Swap would be taking place, it wasn't too early to start name and brand recognition. Our team created "Green Team", which is a group of students that would promote recycling, donating items and an overall "green" campus. The goal of this group was not only to be involved in Drop or Swap but to also expand our solution beyond this event (keep in mind - the original problem was campus waste, and we wanted to have a bigger impact on our campus).<br><br>
           
          In order to publicize, I created a logo for Green Team and posters for Drop or Swap. Posters were placed around the campus. In addition, I created an informational PDF that was placed on TV monitors around campus. A Facebook event was created a month in advance to let students know to start cleaning out their closets and rooms. Lastly, our team communicated with Greek organizations on campus (especially organizations with their own houses located off-campus) and asked if they would donate unwanted items to our event. We advertised a "pick-up" date, where off-campus students could request our team to pick up their unwanted items from their doorstep. This targeted students that lived off-campus, who maybe didn't donate items due to distance between their homes and the on-campus event.<br><br>
           
          To target citizens of Troy, our team tabled at our local Farmers Market. At our table, we had flyers about our event with information about where and when the event was located. In addition, our team attended and tabled at Troy by Design, which is an interactive demo day held at the Center of Gravity in Troy. Here, we had informational flyers and also an activity. We had collected recycled t-shirts and were turning them into no-sew tote bags to carry groceries, books, and more. This was easy enough for kids to do but was also informative about the importance of recycling clothes.<br><br>
           
          To create a better counting method, our team brainstormed. We needed something more efficient than tallies on paper, but not something that involved computers or tablets since we would be outside for 6 hours without outlets. In addition, our team didn't want the counting method to be wasteful of material goods since that would contradict our solution. Given these constraints, I had the idea of using different colored clothespins to mark each category of good. Pink clothespins would be used to mark pants, yellow for shirts, green for jackets, blue for shoes, so on and so forth. We would count the number of items that we collected at the beginning and mark each with a clothespin. When the item was taken home with a student, we would have a check-out table where a Green Team volunteer would take the clothespin off and place the pin in a basket. When the basket was full, the volunteer would count the pins and would take note of the number. The clothespins would then be recycled back to the front where they could be reused for new items donated.
           
          <br><br>

          <h5>Testing</h5>
          Our team was able to test our counting method, but did not test the effectiveness of our steps to publicize the event and was not able to test the impact within the community since the event had yet to take place (I'll get to that in a bit!).<br><br>
           
          To test the counting method, we were able to use members of Design for America Rensselaer as our users. The four members of the team, myself included, acted as the event volunteers. We had a few articles of clothing and used folded sheets of paper as clothespins. We mostly had to explain and quickly demonstrate the counting method due to time limits.
          
          <br><br>
           
          <h5>Final Design - Success!</h5>
          Drop or Swap took place on Saturday, May 14, 2016 from 10am-4pm on the patio of our Student Union.<br><br>
           
          Drop or Swap had an increase in the number of overall items donated compared to the year before. This could be due to the increase in advertising for the event, the off-campus pick up day, or name/brand recognition.<br><br>
           
          The Green Team volunteered at Drop or Swap. In addition to participating in this event, the Green Team also assisted freshman students on move out day with properly recycling or donating unwanted items.<br><br>
           
          The counting method that was tested was used but with minor changes. Instead of using a basket to put the pins in at the end, counting cards were made with slots for ten pins on each side. Once the card was full of pins, the volunteer didn't have to count but could simply recognize that a total of twenty pins was collected and could bring these to the front to be reused. This method was efficient and successful.<br><br>
           
          Other improvements my team made were the customer experience of Drop or Swap. We provided clothing racks and hangers so students could easily view and try on clothes. In addition, we provided full length mirrors for those who tried on clothes. Our last improvement included contacting additional local stores in Troy that would accept our donated items, such as Unity House. By doing so, we recycled items back into our local community and thus had a bigger impact.
          
          <br><br>
           
          <h5>Recommendations</h5>
          The publicity of Drop or Swap could have been measured by surveys (either at Drop or Swap, on Facebook groups, or paper surveys handed out to students) near the event date. If these measures were put into place, our group could have been aware of the effectiveness of our publicity.<br><br>
           
          In addition to counting the items passed through, I would have also liked to count the number of people that attended the event.<br><br>
           
          Lastly, since our team is making progress on campus waste, I would like to tailor the event towards its users, which are the RPI students. Creating a survey of satisfaction of the event would be beneficial since user feedback is always important.

          <h5>My Role</h5>
          My role in this project was brainstorming, prototyping, testing, graphic design for Green Team logo and Drop or Swap posters, and of course volunteering at tabling events and Drop or Swap.</section>
