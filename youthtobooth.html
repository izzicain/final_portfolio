			      			Design for America Nationals requires two representatives from each studio to attend a five day  bootcamp and leadership training event called Leadership Studio. At Leadership Studio, officers and members of DFA have the opportunity to learn leadership skills, how to improve their studios, as well as the human-centered design process. Nationals walks attendees through the design process by teaching it one step at a time, then gives attendees the opportunity to apply the process to their own project. DFA Nationals has a design process consisting of the following steps:
            				<ol>
				              <li>Identify</li>
				              <li>Immerse</li>
				              <li>Reframe</li>
				              <li>Ideate</li>
				              <li>Build</li>
				              <li>Test</li>
				              <li>Implementing</li>
				            </ol>
          					The problem for this project is predetermined by Nationals and must have a functioning solution after three days. Teams are also predetermined by Nationals and consist of five to seven members all from different DFA studios across the country.

			      				The first step in the process is to identify the problem and define targeted problem spaces. This step was completed by conducting primary research, which mainly consisted of reading up on articles found on the Internet related to voting. This step was very important since it allowed our group to familiarize ourselves with the overall voting process, who votes, when users can vote, polling numbers and turnouts based on regions, and other insights. Our group researched different articles and topics for 20 minutes independently and then came together to discuss our findings. This primary research allowed us to understand potential reasons why people were not voting. For example, I found out that voter turnout for the age range of 18-25 year olds was the lowest out of all age ranges; only 16% of 18-25 year olds vote in the US. This statistic stuck out to my group the most since the turnout was so low, thus leading us to believe that the voting experience could be improved for this group. If the experience could be improved for 18-25 year olds, this group would enjoy voting and hopefully the voter turnout would increase, whether in local or national elections.

			      	<div class="collapsible-body">
			      		<div class="design-content">
			      			<span>
			      				The second step in the process is to understand the stakeholders and uncover insights that would better lead us to interpret the problem space. This step was completed by conducting secondary research, which mainly consisted of interviews. Instead of heading out into the streets of Evanston, Design for America Nationals decided it would be safer and more convenient for Leadership Studio attendees to bring the users to us. The users were citizens of Evanston, IL or Chicago IL and came from various backgrounds, such as students, employees of various companies, etc. These users were brought to the studio over a course of two hours; we had 30 minutes with each user and rotated through a total of four users. Our group assigned two members to take notes during the interview while the other two would ask questions.
					          	<br><br>
					          	Our group asked predetermined questions asking about various aspects of the voting process. Such questions included telling us a story about their most memorable 	voting experience and asking about their voting habits.
					          	<br><br>
					          	In addition, DFA Nationals provided a panel of experts. This panel consisted of five members, all working in a field relating to he voting process, whether working at voting polls, helping to register voters or government employees that worked with the voting process. The panel members had more experience working behind the scenes in the voting process because their careers revolved around it rather than acting as a "typical citizen" who is only involved in voting when there are upcoming elections.
					          	<br><br>
					          	Another team member and I had the opportunity to sit in on this panel with about 30 other Leadership Studio attendees. The panel members all introduced themselves and then opened the floor to questions that the attendees had. Multiple panel members could answer the same question, or if they all had similar answers, only one panel member spoke. This panel was a great opportunity for our group since we could ask these experts questions that we had about the overall voting process to clear up any confusion.

			      	<div class="collapsible-body">
			      		<div class="design-content">
			      			<span>
			      				The third step in this process is to reframe the problem by analyzing and synthesize the data collected through the previous step. To do this, each member of my group read over the data they collected (or, if they were the interviewers, looked onto the note taker's notes) and took note of sentences, facts, or other points they deemed "important". These "important" facts and quotes were defined as things that could be wrong with the voting process, things people liked about the voting process and wanted to see more of, potential areas of improvement, and more; our group was mainly focused on finding areas of improvement. Each member worked by his/herself and wrote down each point on its own sticky note. After, our group came together and shared the important facts and quotes that stuck out with each other. We then moved onto clustered our stickies by categories, which were personal, knowledge, logistics, .and influences. Clustering allowed our group to visualize and see which category had the most stickies, or see how the stickies and categories overlapped. A lot of our quotes from interviews and the panels had to do with engaging students and young citizens in the voting process.
          						<br><br>
          						The next step of reframing is to write our "How Can We's". How Can We's are something that DFA Nationals uses as a way to get groups to solidify and define their problem in a short, concise sentence. HCW's are structured by using the following format: "How Can We + user + behavior + place". Our group formulated HCWs individually and then came together to discuss what we individually brainstormed. Categorizing our stickies, we were able to visually see which groups had a lot of areas of improvement, thus allowing our group to move forward. Some How Can We's included "How can we keep whole families engaged in the voting process?" and "HCW engage kids at the voting polls?". The HCW that we chose to pursue was "How can we increase participation and investment in the voting process for children of a young age?".

			      		<div class="design-content">
			      			<span>
			      				This next step, ideating, involves brainstorming a variety of ways to come up with a potential solution for the problem. Once our group knew we wanted to work with children, families and schools to instill the voting process at a young age, it was easy to move on from there. This process was completed by individually brainstorming potential solutions, places to work in, people to work with, or anything else our team members deemed necessary. After the individual brainstorm was completed, we came together as a group and mapped out our solutions by clustering these sticky notes in categories. Once clustered, our group used a voting process to decide which methods we saw had the most potential. Each member was allowed three votes, marking the sticky note with a symbol unique to each member. The stickies with the most votes moved onto the final process.
						          <br><br>
						        Our group was intrigued by the idea of implementing the voting process at a young age. By teaching kids the importance of government (local and national) and how to vote, they would (hopefully) recognize that they have a voice in the country's democracy. Ideas that came from our sticky note brainstorming sessions include a "Voting Passport" for kids, mini-polling stations for kids, and goody bags or activities for kids at polling places. The voting passport and mini-polling station were the two ideas with the highest number of votes. Our group was excited about the idea of families starting a conversation about the importance of government as well as being active with their kids. In addition, the mini voting station allowed children to vote for something that could have an impact on their lives, such as bringing in a guest performer or speaker. By starting the voting process at a young age, our group was hoping that this habit would transfer over as they become registered voters.

			      				Once our ideas were solidified, our group moved onto building our prototypes. This step allowed our group to communicate and test our ideas to potential users.
						          <br><br>
						        To create the voting passport, we started by making a booklet. This book had spots for places, such as the local library, school, grocery store, City Hall, and more with an empty box adjacent to each place. The empty box was a placeholder for stickers to be received at each destination if certain activities were completed, such as checking out a book about government at the local library or talking to a history teacher about our country's government at the local school. The final destination in the booklet was the voting booth, where families could bring their kids along to see how registered voters voted.
						          <br><br>
						        To build the mini polling station, we made a scaled-down version due to the limited materials provided. The polling station was meant for kids and would be placed at the voting booths where their parents or guardians voted. The kids would cast their vote for who they wanted to see perform or present at their town (school, library, etc; destination to be determined). Example candidates were Bill Nye the Science Guy, any astronaut, the Kratt brothers, etc.

			      				Since the timeline of the project was so tight, time did not permit our group to test these solutions with multiple users of our desired targeted group, being children and families. The first round of testing was with other Design for America attendees. We showed them our prototypes, explained our design, asked follow-up questions and received feedback.
          						<br><br> 
						        The second round of testing was with participants that DFA Nationals brought it, such as students, citizens of Chicago with a wide age range, and more. No children were brought in, so our prototypes were not tested as we hoped. Instead, we asked participants about their families, neighbors who had kids, grandchildren, nieces, nephews and more. By demonstrating our prototypes, participants had to imagine completing these activities with their kids, neighbors, etc. Our group was able to collect valuable feedback that way.
						        <br><br> 
						        Changes we made to our prototypes include targeting a specific age range. For example, many testers said that the prototypes would be successful with elementary-aged children so we changed some of the locations and activities to accommodate this younger group.

			      				Since the elections were not to take place for months, we were not able to implement these designs. Instead, Leadership Studio held a final expo for all teams to present their projects. We demonstrated our prototypes to all Leadership Studio attendees, DFA National members and other expo attendees. Our group received more feedback.
