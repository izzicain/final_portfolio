			      			<span>The chapter of Design for America Rensselaer was founded in 2014 by six Rensselaer students. DFA Rensselaer started as a club called DeCo: Design Collaboration, but was changed to DFA Rensselaer once the application to become a part of the national network was submitted and accepted. DFA RPI was one of 4 studios accepted out of 73 total applicants for 2014.
		         			<br><br>
		         			DFA Rensselaer typically has twenty to thirty students actively involved which make up four to five project teams, each team consisting of four to six students. These project teams tackle a wide range of problems within our community. Past project include distracted driving, involving girls in STEM, Hunger in Troy, campus mental health and more.</span>

			      				<h6>Community and Team Member</h6>
					          	I joined Design for America Rensselaer during my freshman year, which was also the club's first year as an official DFA studio. I found out about DFA Rensselaer when one of the club's officers visited a course I was taking, PDI (Programs in Design and Innovation) Studio I. I wasn't aware at the time, but Design for America Rensselaer officers often recruited PDI students into DFA. PDI students learn the design process in earlier Studios (I-III) and this process is very similar to the one Design for America practices. After giving a brief description of the club and the projects DFA Rensselaer was pursuing, I was intrigued and decided to join. I also thought it would be beneficial to get extra design experience outside of PDI Studio courses and make connections with other students on the Rensselaer campus.
					          	<br><br>
					          	DFA Rensselaer had two types of membership: community and team members. Community members had a lower level of commitment, only attending weekly General Body Meetings and helping out other members with their projects. Team members had a higher level of commitment, attending both weekly General Body Meetings as well as meeting outside of GBMs with their team. Team members worked with three to five other team members on one assigned project for a semester or year. When I joined DFA Rensselaer, I joined as a community member to get a feel for the club and see if it was something I wanted to stick with.
					          	<br><br>
					          	After the uneventful semester as a community member passed, I decided to change my membership status to a Team Member. I was willing to commit more time to work closely with a team of dedicated students to solve a problem. My first project was Cradle to Cradle; I worked with three other students to create a product that was 100% recyclable and eco-friendly. This product was encouraged to have multiple life cycles, thus being sturdy and durable. After researching, brainstorming, ideating, researching again, prototyping, testing and prototyping again, our team completed the project. Our team created a 3D printer filament package, called FilaBox, that was 100% recyclable and eco-friendly. Made out of cardboard and metal, this package could be reused by sending it back to filament companies to be respooled. The package was stackable, allowing for convenient storage and use. My role in this project included brainstorming, ideating, prototyping, testing and research.

			      				<h6>Leadership</h6>
					          	When I returned to DFA Rensselaer for my third year, I was an elected officer. I decided to run for an officer position since I was enthusiastic for the work that Design for America did. I wanted to share my passion for this club with members of the community, especially RPI students, by recruiting them and making DFA a bigger part of our campus. In addition, I believed I would make an essential asset to the leadership team by bringing new and exciting ideas to the table. I work well with others and believe I am good at managing large groups of people.
					          	<br><br>
					          	I was elected Team Manager of Design for America Rensselaer. This position was co-president of the studio and came with several responsibilities, such as...
					          		<ul>
							            <li>-Acting as the liaison to project teams as well as providing direct mentorship of teams and overseeing officer/team relationships</li>
							            <li>-Managing the five other officers and keeping all events/meetings on track</li>
							            <li>-Ensuring that members are learning the human centered design process; lectures were given through PowerPoints, demonstrations and activities</li>
							            <li>-Planning the semester calendar (design process lectures, workshops, socials, guest visits, and more)</li>
							            <li>-Assigning team members to project teams at the beginning of the semesters</li>
							            <li>-Attending monthly meetings with our faculty advisors</li>
							            <li>-Attending necessary workshops giving by our Student Union in order to have appropriate leadership skills as well as knowledge on our budget and travel procedures.</li>
						        	</ul>
					          	In addition to these responsibilities, two out of our six officers were required to attend Leadership Studio, a five day event put on by Design for America Nationals in Evanston, Illinois. Each studio across the country is required to send at least two representatives to learn leadership skills as well as take part in a three day project where we reviewed the human centered design process. I was fortunate enough to attend this event with two other DFA Rensselaer officers. To see the design project I worked on at Leadership Studio, please visit <a href="project3.html" class="hover-bold">Youth to Booth</a>.
					          	<br><br>
					          	The first semester of my leadership went smoothly. I found myself adjusting to the position mostly during the first half of the semester and taking on more leadership responsibilities during the second half. I fulfilled all of my outlined responsibilities during the first semester.
					          	<br><br> 
					          	The second semester of my leadership was vastly different from the first. Due to three of our six officers leaving the club, I was forced to absorb two of these vacant positions, being Administrative Manager (the other co-president) and Financial Chair. In summary, I had to be the main point of contact with the Student Union and school deans, maintain and fully understand budget, plan our annual fund raiser and collect dues on top of all of my original Team Manager responsibilities. The Administrative Manager, being the other co-president, shared a lot of responsibilities with me during the first semester but I learned to perform these duties on my own during the second semester and take on full responsibility for presidential duties. My time commitment to the club substantially increased as I took on more tasks. Organizational, time-management, delegation and communication skills were all abilities I had prior to being a DFA officer, but this semester profoundly refined them (keep in mind - in addition to this, I was also the secretary of Photography Club, Managerial and Copy &amp; Composing Editor of a campus magazine, and in a sorority. I like to keep busy!).
					          	<br><br>
					          	Changes and improvements I made to Design for America Rensselaer during my time as Team Manager include restructuring the officer roles. Keeping the original six officers in place, I redefined some roles to even the workload between all officers and made sure each officer's skills were being fully utilized. I did this because I noticed some officers were getting bored and would participate less in meetings due to a lack of responsibility. Hopefully by evening the workload, all officers feel like they are contributing something to the club and will participate by bringing new ideas to the table.
					          	<br><br>
					          	In addition, I restructured the membership roles. Officers and I noticed the attendance of community membership was low (below 20% for all community members). After talking to these members, some with high attendance and others with low, the officers and I noticed that the community members were concerned with the time commitment of the club, thus being community members (low-time commitment) and not team members (higher time commitment). In addition, community members voiced that working for the "community" of DFA Rensselaer did not provide enough work to do, thus resulting in low attendance rate ("Why bother coming to a meeting if I don't have any work to get done or anything to contribue?"). The officers and I noticed that these members needed a structured project with deadlines. This would hopefully keep up their attendance during General Body Meetings since these members would have assigned work to complete and goals to meet throughout the semester. After coming to a conclusion, I decided it was in the club's best interest to change the role of community members. Instead of working for the "community" of DFA Rensselaer, this new type of membership, later coined as sub-committee membership, would be assigned to a project team of their choosing but not have the same time commitment nor responsibilities of team members. Sub-committee members, much like community members, are required to attend weekly GBMs but not outside of club meetings. This way, sub-committee members would have a designated project to work on and could be part of a team to motivate them to participate.
					          	<br><br>
					          	Other improvements I made to DFA Rensselaer included typing up an eleven-page "process guide" (editing thanks to DFA Rensselaer founders and previous officers, Jeric Bautista and Selina Tedesco). This process guide outlined every aspect of DFA Rensselaer, which includes officer roles, club structure, membership roles, recruiting, project teams, meetings, and more. The purpose of this process guide is to provide a written sources of how the club operates. In addition, I found the transition between previous year's officers and 2016-2017 officers to be weak and inadequate. This guide would hopefully help future officers understand the club and their roles better.
